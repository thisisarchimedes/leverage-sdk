## Installation Steps

### 1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub

- Go to your GitHub settings.
- Click on "Developer settings" in the sidebar.
- Select "Personal access tokens" and then "Generate new token".
- Give your token a name, select the expiration period, and set the scopes. For npm packages, you usually need `read:packages` to download packages and `write:packages` to publish them.
- Click "Generate token" at the bottom. Remember to copy your new personal access token; you wonâ€™t be able to see it again!

### 2. Add PAT Token to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`

- Open `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` in a text editor.
- Add the following line:
  ```bash
  export PAT_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token_here"
  ```
- Save the file and run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.profile` to apply the changes.

### 3. Create `.npmrc` File

- In the root of your project (where `package.json` is located), create a file named `.npmrc`.

### 4. Add Content to `.npmrc`

- Open the `.npmrc` file in a text editor.
- Add the following content:
  ```
  @thisisarchimedes:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
  //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${PAT_TOKEN}
  ```

### 5. Add Package to `package.json`

- In your `package.json`, add the dependency:

  ```json
  "@thisisarchimedes/leverage-sdk": "latest"
  ```

  After completing these steps, run `npm install` to install your dependencies. The configuration in your `.npmrc` will authenticate with GitHub Packages to fetch the `@thisisarchimedes/leverage-sdk` package.

### 6. Install project packages

```
npm install
```
